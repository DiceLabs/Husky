# Object Perception and navigation
The `ml_test` package enables object perception functionality, as well as navigation to perceived objects. As of now, the navigation script cannot handle dynamic objects, or objects which are not part of the originally generated map. A modified script will be made to try to fix this issue.


# Robot arm manipulation
The `test` package enables robot arm end-effector-to-perceived object interaction. The script in this package also handles final orientation of the end effector so it correctly interacts with object. This package has recently been tested with "bottle" objects.
